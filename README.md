# RSEFX (RSE)
Retro Survival Engine Framework Extended is a lightweight engine framework that I first created for a simple retro like zombie survival game with terminal graphics (RSE) that I was planning to develop, which later got expanded (RSEFX). I scratched the retro zombie survival game, but its legacy on RSEFX still lives on (hence the repo name and the global namespace being called RSE).
The project got discontinued when I quickly reached the limitations of SDL's renderer. I've decided to rewrite this framework entirely and rebrand it. Maybe even turn it into a lightweight 3D game engine with a UI written in WPF that will use my own renderer written in OpenGL.
